        <h1>Basic Pong</h1>
        
        <p>I designed a two-player game similar to Pong by Atari, Inc.  Primary functions include key handlers, a draw function with updates, a ball spawner, and a new game function.  This Python program runs using two imported packages, simpleguitk and random.</p>
        
        <p>As soon as the code is run, the game starts by generating a ball with a random velocity and direction (within certain constraints so as to not make the ball too fast or the angle of the ball such that it would take a long time for the ball to reach a paddle).  Player 1 uses the 'w' and 's' keys to move the paddle up and down.  Player 2 does the same using the up and down arrow keys.  The players attempt to bounce the ball off their padddle, preventing the ball from falling in their respective gutter.  If a ball falls into the gutter, a point is awarded to the opposing player.</p>
        
        <p>After the program was working in CodeSkulptor (an interactive, web-based Python programming environment that allows Python code to be run in a web browser), I ran into an issue in which player 2's paddle remained locked or unresponsive to the up, left, and right arrow keys.  Since I am having a similar issue with another program in CodeSkulptor and since this program was bug free for a couple months, I suspect the issue might be related to a browser update or CodeSkulptor udpate.</p>
